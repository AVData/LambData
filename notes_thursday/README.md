Square root functions and data helper functions for unittest and pytest

# What is going on?
In this repo live two files containing code for square root functions, and data
helper functions; both of which are used to practice the unittest methodology
within the terminal.  The sqrt.py file contains three different forms of the
square root function, and the data helper function is a function build to parse
strings of text.
